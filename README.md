# Decentralized Skill Verification Network

## Project Description

The Decentralized Skill Verification Network is a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes how professional skills are verified, validated, and monetized in the digital economy. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this system creates a trustless environment where individuals can stake tokens to verify others' skills, while skilled professionals can earn rewards by completing bounties that match their verified expertise.

The platform eliminates the need for centralized certification authorities by implementing a peer-to-peer verification system where community members stake their own tokens to vouch for others' skills. This creates a self-regulating ecosystem where false verifications are financially penalized through slashing mechanisms, ensuring the integrity of skill assessments.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a global, decentralized marketplace where skills are the primary currency of value exchange. We envision a future where:

- **Universal Skill Recognition**: Skills verified on our platform are recognized globally, transcending geographical and institutional boundaries
- **Merit-Based Economy**: Opportunities are distributed based on verified competencies rather than credentials or connections
- **Continuous Learning Incentives**: The system rewards skill development and maintains up-to-date professional capabilities
- **Transparent Reputation Systems**: Professional reputations are built on verifiable on-chain achievements rather than subjective recommendations
- **Financial Inclusion**: Skilled individuals worldwide can access economic opportunities regardless of their traditional educational background or location

## Key Features

### üîê **Stake-Based Skill Verification**
- Community members stake ETH to verify others' skills on a 1-10 proficiency scale
- Verifiers put their own tokens at risk, ensuring honest assessments
- Time-limited verifications that require renewal to maintain validity
- Anti-fraud measures through self-verification prevention

### üíº **Smart Bounty System**
- Skill-specific job postings with automatic qualification checking
- Escrow-based payment system ensuring secure transactions
- Deadline-based bounty management with automatic expiration
- Creator-controlled assignment process for quality assurance

### üìä **Reputation & Profile Management**
- Comprehensive user profiles tracking verified skills and achievements
- Dynamic reputation scoring based on successful completions and skill diversity
- Historical tracking of all bounties and verification activities

cd decentralized-skill-verification-network

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Usage Examples
```javascript
// Verify a skill (staking 0.1 ETH)
await contract.verifySkill(userAddress, "JavaScript", 8, { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1") });

// Create a bounty (with 1 ETH reward)
await contract.createBounty("Solidity", 7, "Smart contract development", 30, { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1.0") });

// Complete assigned bounty
await contract.completeBounty(bountyId);
```
